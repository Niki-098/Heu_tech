1SUPERVISED LEARNING
(SESSION-2018-19)(Regression & Classification)
OVERVIEW OF MACHINE LEARNING
Machine Learning is the process of creating models that can perform a certain task 
without the need for a human explicitly programming it to do something.

2WHAT IS SUPERVISED LEARNING?
Dogs and cats both have 4 legs and a tail.
Dogs come in small to large sizes. Cats, on 
the other hand, are always small.
Dogs have a long mouth while cats have 
smaller mouths.
Dogs bark while cats meow.
Different dogs have different ears while 
cats have almost the same kind of ears.FEATURES
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Supervised learning gives the algorithm experience which can be used to
output the predictions for new unseen data
Experience also helps in optimizing the performance of the algorithm

3TYPES OF SUPERVISED LEARNING 
(REGRESSION & CLASSIFICATION)
Regression: Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique
which investigates the relationship between a dependent and independent
variable.
USES OF REGRESSION 
Determining the strength of predictors (strength of the effect that the
independent variable have on the dependent variable)
Forecasting an effect
Trend forecasting

LINEAR REGRESSION 
R-SQUARED VALUE
R-squared value is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the
fitted regression line.
It is also known as coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple
determination

12LOGISTIC REGRESSION
Logistic Regression produces result in a binary format which is used to predict the
outcome of a categorical dependent variable. So the outcome should be
discrete/categoricalsuch as:

14CLASSIFICATION 
Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be
performedon both structured or unstructured data.
The process starts with predicting the class of given data points. The classes are often
referredto as target, label or categories.

15TYPES OF LEARNERS IN CLASSIFICATION
CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS
In machine learning, classification is a supervised learning concept which basically
categorizes a set of data into classes.

9/8/2018
16LOGISTIC REGRESSION
It is a classification algorithm in machine learning that uses one or more independent
variablesto determine an outcome.
It will have only two possible outcomes.
NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER
It is a classification algorithm based on Bayes’s theorem which gives an assumption of
independence among predictors.
In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular
feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

17STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT
It is a very effective and simple approachto fit linear models.
Stochastic Gradient Descent is particularly useful when the sample data is in a large
number.
K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR
It is a lazy learning algorithm that stores all instances corresponding to training data
in n-dimensional space.
It is a lazy learning algorithm as it does not focus on constructing a general internal
model, instead, it works on storing instances of training data.

18DECISION TREE
The decision tree algorithm builds the classification model in the form of a tree
structure.
RANDOM FOREST
Random decision trees or random forest are an ensemble learning method for
classification, regression, etc.
It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs
the class that is the mode of the classes or classification or mean
prediction(regression)of the individual trees.

19ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS
A neural network consists of neurons that are arranged in layers, they take some input
vector and convert it into an output. The process involves each neuron taking input
and applying a function which is often a non-linear function to it and then passes the
output to the next layer.
SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
The support vector machine is a
classifier that represents the training
data as points in space separated
into categories by a gap as wide as
possible. New points are then
added to space by predicting which
category they fall into and which
space they will belong to.

20CLASSIFIER EVALUATION
HOLDOUT METHOD
This is the most common method to evaluate a classifier. In this method, the given data 
set is divided into two parts as a test and train set 20% and 80% respectively.
The train set is used to train the data and the unseen test set is used to test its 
predictive power.

21CROSS-VALIDATION
Over-fitting is the most common problem prevalent
in most of the machine learning models. K-fold
cross-validation can be conducted to verify if the
model is over-fitted at all.
In this method, the data set is randomly
partitioned into k mutually exclusive subsets, each
of which is of the same size. Out of these, one is
kept for testing and others are used to train the
model. The same process takes place for all k
folds.

22ROC CURVE
Receiver operating characteristics or ROC curve is used for visual comparison of
classification models, which shows the relationship between the true positive rate and
the false positive rate. The area under the ROC curve is the measure of the accuracy
of the model.
