What is Deep Learning? 
Page | 4Deep Learning is a subset of machine 
learning in artificial intelligence (AI) 
Deep learning - also called as deep neural learning or deep neural network, has networks capable of learning 
that can be supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabelled. 
These algorithms use multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from raw input
An artificial neuron network (ANN): It is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks
What is Neural 
Network?ANNs are considered nonlinear statistical data modeling tools where the complex relationships between inputs and outputs are modeled or patterns are found
More efficient and accurate than other traditional algorithms techniquesANN can be used for both - Supervised and Unsupervised learning
Why Neural 
Network?It can be used for both Unstructured and Structured data Works with more accuracy and efficiency for unstructured data
Where Neural 
Networks are used?Used in pattern recognition because of their ability to generalise and to respond to unexpected inputs/patternsProblems for which algorithmic method is expensive or does not existNeural networks can learn by example, hence we do not need to program it, to that extent
Requires additional devices for processing supportNeural Network is still a black box model - it is hard to look "into" the network and figure out exactly what it has learntComputation time is more

Application Areas of Deep Learning 
Page | 9Key areas where Neural Networks plays a 
significant role
Text analytics refers to a discipline of computer science that combines machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to draw meaning from unstructured text documents.Language Processing
“Multi-touch attribution” refers to the martech attribution solution that tracks a series of touchpoints through the funnel and assigns revenue credits to those touchpoints.Multi Channel Attribution
Computer vision is concerned with the theory and technology for building artificial systems that obtain information from images or multi-dimensional data.Computer Vision
Video Analytics uses mathe -
matical algorithms to monitor, analyze and manage large volumes of video. It digitally analyzes video inputs; transforming them into intelligent data which helps in taking decisions.Video Analytics
Cognitive computing process uses a blend of artificial intelligence, neural networks, machine learning, natural language processing, sentiment analysis and contextual awareness to solve day-to-day problems just like humans.Cognitive Computing
Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste 
information from many users  
(collaborating).Collaborative Filtering
Computer Vision in Deep Learning 
Page | 11Introduction to Computer Vision
Computer Vision seeks to develop techniques to help 
computers “see” and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.
Computer vision works
in three basic steps:
Acquiring an image 
Images, even large sets, can be acquired in real-time through video, photos or 3D technology for analysis. 
Processing the image 
Deep learning models automate much of this process, but the models are often trained by first being fed thousands of labeled or pre-identified images.
Understanding the image 
The final step is the interpretative step, where an object is identified or classified.

Language Processing in Deep Learning
Page | 14Introduction to Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI “that deals with human-computer interaction through natural (human) 
languages”. NLP trains computers to understand, decipher and manipulate human languages: spoken and written
Natural Language Understanding:
Involves interpretation of language. Examples: HomePod, Alexa and Google AssistantNatural Language Generation: Involves producing meaningful language as output. Examples: Automatic captions in YouTube, chatbots, automated journalism (Associated Press)
Ambiguity in spoken/written language 
is the main challenge in NLP
Meaning of words change depending on the context
Meaning based on punctuation
Detecting attitude/intention: anger, sadness, sarcasm, irony Homepod
Spam classificationHandwriting Recognition

traditional statistical models
Contextual Information is captured 
Machine learning models are designed 
to make the most accurate predictions possible. Statistical models are designed for inference about the relationships between variables
Deep Learning does much better than 
statistical methods on unstructured data (video, sound, text, pictures)
Cognitive Computing
Page | 18Introduction to Cognitive Computing
Cognitive computing is the use of computerized models to simulate the human thought process in complex situations where the 
answers may be ambiguous and uncertain. The phrase is closely associated with IBM's cognitive computer system, Watson.
Based on the scientific disciplines of artificial intelligence and signal processingPlatform uses machine learning, reasoning, natural language processing, speech recognition and vision, human computer interaction, dialog and narrative generation, among other technologies

Multi-channel attribution is a set of rules that assigns credit for sales and revenue to touch points across the customer journey.The 
purpose of attribution is to help marketers understand what marketing actions and touchpoints influence revenue and conversions.
